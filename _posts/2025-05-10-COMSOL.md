At Cocoon, I have been able to use COMSOL Multiphysics to further investigate the Induction Furnace system that is outlined in one of the models I showcase in the mathematical Models Post.
This enabled me to replace the experimentally measured source terms, by simulating the magnetic field generated by the copper coils in our paticular Furnace and susceptor combination.
This meant that we could overcome the difficulty of high temperature measurements, as the source terms are analytical. 
This, as well as including the graphite non-linearity from scientific journals, meant that I acheived an accurate model, which improved our temperature control at high tempoeratures.

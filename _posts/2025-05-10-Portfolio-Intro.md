This portfolio showcases the engineering projects I have undertaken during my time studying for an MEng in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Birmingham, as well as my work as a Research and Development Engineer at Cocoon Carbon, 
a steel slag startup. There, I work with engineers and scientists in developing a novel slag upcycling process, which in my time at the company has gone from TRL 4 to TRL 7.

<b>About me:</b>
I'm a passionate engineer, driven by a deep curiosity for how things work and a desire to solve real-world problems. 
I thrive on hands-on projects and continuous learning, always seeking opportunities to apply theory to practice—which the projects on this website reflect.

Outside of engineering, I enjoy sports: I play ice hockey and football, though I can happily watch just about anything.
My hobbies include reading—I'm currently halfway through the second book in The Three Musketeers series by Dumas, which I highly recommend. 
I've also recently gotten into FPV drone design. I enjoy the customization options in the avionics, and analog cameras are very cool. Plus, flying them is incredibly fun.

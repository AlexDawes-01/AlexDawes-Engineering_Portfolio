**What I'm Currently Learning**
<br><br>
In order to supplement my CFD experience from university using commercial codes such as Ansys Fluent, I have been interested in getting closer to the underlying maths, 
then I heard about OpenFoam, where the solvers and variables are easily accesible in files and can be edited with complete bespoke control. Meaning the set-up is harder, but usage rewards more understanding. 
In light of this goal and to develop my coding and simulation skills, I am pursuing several OpenFoam course on Udemy.
I hope to be able to use the open source software to one day develop my own computational models to solve bespoke engineering problems,
enhancing my understanding of commercial CFD and FEA softwares.
<br><br>
Please see an image from a simple multiphase slag flow simulation I have created using multiphaseInterFoam on OpenFoam.
Multiphase flow introduces the alpha term in the VOF (Volume of fluid) method In which the fluid properties of a cell depend on the blend of two fluids contrrolled by this alpha term. 
I hope to mature this knowledge and skill through these courses and personal projects.

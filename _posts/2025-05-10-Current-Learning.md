**What I'm Currently Learning**
<br><br>
To build on the CFD experience I gained at university using commercial tools like ANSYS Fluent, Iâ€™ve been keen to deepen my understanding of the underlying mathematics. 
That led me to OpenFOAM, an open-source CFD platform where the solvers and variables are fully accessible and customizable through editable files.
While the setup is more complex compared to commercial software, it offers far greater insight and control, rewarding users with a deeper grasp of the physics and numerical methods involved.
In light of this goal and to develop my coding and simulation skills, I am pursuing several OpenFoam course on Udemy.
I hope to be able to use the open source software to one day develop my own computational models to solve bespoke engineering problems,
enhancing my understanding of commercial CFD and FEA softwares.
<br><br>
Please see an image from a simple multiphase slag flow simulation I have created using multiphaseInterFoam on OpenFoam.
Multiphase flow introduces the alpha term in the VOF (Volume of fluid) method In which the fluid properties of a cell depend on the blend of two fluids contrrolled by this alpha term. 
I hope to mature this knowledge and skill through these courses and personal projects.

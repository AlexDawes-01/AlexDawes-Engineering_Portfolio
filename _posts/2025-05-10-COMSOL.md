**Comsol:Induction Furnace Simulation**
<br><br>
At Cocoon, I used COMSOL Multiphysics to further investigate the induction furnace system featured in one of the models showcased in the Mathematical Models post. 
This allowed me to replace experimentally measured source terms by simulating the magnetic field generated by the copper coils in our specific furnace and susceptor configuration. 
By doing so, we overcame the challenges of high-temperature measurements, as the source terms became analytically derived. 
Incorporating the temperature-dependent non-linearity of graphite—sourced from scientific literature—enabled me to build an accurate model that significantly improved temperature control at high operating temperatures.

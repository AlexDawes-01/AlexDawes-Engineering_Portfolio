This portfolio showcases the engineering projects I have undertaken,
In my time studying for my Meng In mechanical Engineering at the University of Birmingham,
and as a Research and Development Engineer at a steel slag valorisation startup (Cocoon Carbon) 
working alongside engineers and scientists developing a novel slag upcycling process.

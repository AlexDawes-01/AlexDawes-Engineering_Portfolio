Please Find attached two of my engineering drawings, which were used by manufacturers to fabricate parts which were subsequently
used within their relevant systems. <br><br>
<b>High Pressure Nozzle Holder</b>
<br>
The task was to design a high-pressure nozzle with an internal NPT thread, capable of withstanding internal pressures of up to 400 bar. 
The nozzle needed to mount onto 40Ã—40 extrusion and support interchangeable inserts with varying bore sizes.

The final design, shown below, minimizes the number of machining operations, applies an appropriate safety factor for indefinite use under high pressure, and is engineered to resist mechanical impacts and high temperatures critical for its intended application. <br>

<b>Molten fluid nozzle</b>
The design required a high-temperature, chemically resilient nozzle with precisely defined bore sizes and locations. Tolerances were carefully selected with manufacturability in mind. Balancing what is realistically achievable to reduce production costs, while remaining tight enough to ensure proper function and assembly. <br>

Please Find attached two of my engineering drawings, which were used by manufacturers to fabricate parts which were subsequently
used within their relevant systems. <br><br>
<b>High Pressure Nozzle Holder</b>
<br>
The task was to design a nozzle with an NPT internal threading, that could sustain pressures of 400 bar internally. To be mounted on 40-40 extrusion, and could interchange nozzles of different bore.
The design below reduces the number of machining operations, applies appropriate saftey factor for indefinite use at high pressure, is resistant to knocks and high temperatures.
Which was needed for its application. <br>

<br><br>
<b>Molten fluid nozzle</b>
The design required a high temperature, chemically resilient nozzle, with appropriate bore sizes and locations.
With the manufacturing process in mind, the tolerances applied take into account what is realistically acheivable, reducing cost for individual components,
but are tight enough to maintain function. <br>

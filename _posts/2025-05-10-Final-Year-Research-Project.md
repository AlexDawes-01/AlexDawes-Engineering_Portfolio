**Design and Process Parameter Optimization for Improving the Mechanical Properties of LPBF Gyroid Lattices**

In this project, I developed neural network models to optimize the mechanical properties of triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) gyroid lattice structures manufactured via laser powder bed fusion. By integrating process and design parameters, I successfully predicted Young's modulus and yield strength in both network and sheet gyroids made from Ti-6Al-4V, a titanium alloy crucial for biomedical implants.

My research revealed that network gyroids display simpler process-thermal-structure-property relationships, while sheet variants achieve superior mechanical properties despite greater variability.
I'm particularly pleased that these findings have direct applications for bone implants, where appropriate mechanical properties prevent stress shielding; which can lead to 
failure of any implants.

I implemented Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) pre-training to overcome limited data challenges, which notably improved prediction accuracy for mechanical properties. 
While identifying limitations such as surface quality issues and data set size, my work establishes a methodology to develop process maps to guide design and fabrication to tailor gyroid based implants to individual patients.
And serves asfoundation for future research in physics-informed neural networks and real-time monitoring techniques.
A brief overview of SAE can be seen below; and some process maps developed during this work.

This project enhanced my expertise in both LPBF manufacturing and applied machine learning, paticularly within the realm of additive manufacturing. 

This project has since been adapted into the format of a journal paper and is currently under peer review by Progress in additive manufacturing, springer nature <a href="https://alexdawes-01.github.io/AlexDawes-Engineering_Portfolio/assets/files/Final-Report.pdf" download>Journal Correspondence and list of authors</a>.

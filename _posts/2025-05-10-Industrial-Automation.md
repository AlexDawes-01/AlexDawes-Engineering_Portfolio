**Industrial Process Automation: Safety-Enhanced Control System with Siemens S7-1200 PLC**

I led the automation of Cocoon's novel slag upcycling system by implementing a comprehensive control system using a Siemens S7-1200 series PLC. I designed and programmed robust safety protocols, including automatic sensor triggered shutdowns and loss of power logic, to ensure operational compliance with slag handlers. 
I also engineered real-time monitoring capabilities to track performance, enabling data driven decision making and early fault detection. 
Additionally, I developed a secure remote access interface, allowing operators to monitor and control the system from a safe distance; greatly enhancing operator safety and reducing response times to critical events.

This project gave me practical, hands-on experience in control system implementation, including PLC programming, analogue and digital signalling, and wiring electrical control cabinets. 
It also enabled Cocoon to begin testing the process in an operational steel plant. A major milestone in the companyâ€™s journey from startup to revenue generating business.

Above all, this project deepened my understanding of the role of control systems across engineering applications. I saw firsthand the value of simple, robust logic; the importance of failsafes; and the benefits of minimizing computational complexity to improve performance. 
Tuning the system for real world conditions and applying the mathematical concepts I'd learned at university, was a rewarding full-circle moment for me.

Some images from the trial are shown below. Due to contractual obligations, I cannot share more than this.

Design and Process Parameter Optimization for Improving the Mechanical Properties of LPBF Gyroid Lattices

This research represents my contribution to advancing machine learning applications for triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) gyroid lattice structures manufactured via laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). 
I successfully developed neural network models that integrate process and design parameters to predict key mechanical properties such as Young's modulus and yield strength in these complex structures.
My investigation focused on two variants of TPMS gyroids—network and sheet—constructed from Ti-6Al-4V, a titanium alloy commonly used in biomedical implants. 
Through systematic experimentation, I expanded the existing knowledge base with new data points that enabled more accurate predictions. The analysis revealed that network gyroids exhibit more straightforward process-thermal-structure-property relationships, while sheet gyroids achieve higher mechanical properties but with greater variability. I'm particularly proud that these findings have direct relevance for biomedical applications such as bone implants, where appropriate mechanical properties help prevent stress shielding.

One of my key technical achievements was implementing Stacked Autoencoder pre-training techniques to overcome the challenge of limited data availability, which notably improved prediction accuracy for mechanical properties, especially yield strength. 
I also identified important limitations, including surface quality inconsistencies and the need for expanded datasets to improve model generalization. 
These observations have helped me outline promising directions for future research, including physics-informed neural networks and real-time monitoring approaches to address surface defects.
This work has deepened my expertise in both LPBF manufacturing and applied machine learning while contributing valuable insights to the field.
By connecting computational modeling with practical fabrication challenges, my research offers a meaningful step forward in the growing field of additive manufacturing and its applications in biomedical engineering.

This project has since been adapted into the format of a journal paper and is currently under peer review by Progress in additive manufacturing, springer nature.

**My Experience developing Matehmatical models**

I have developed several mathematical models in my time as a student and an engineer, two i would like to highlight are a Finite difference approximation 
that i used to evaluate temperatures within an induction furnace. And a cylindrical stress calculator to calcaulate stresses within an arrangment of stacked cylinders 
undergoing thermal expansion, where thermal stress arise from different expansion co-efficients.

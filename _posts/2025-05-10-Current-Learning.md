**What I'm Currently Learning**
<br><br>
I have recently been interested in developing my coding and simulation skills, by pursuing several OpenFoam course on Udemy.
I hope to be able to use the open source software to one day develop my own computational models to solve bespoke engineering problems,
and to enhance my understanding of conmmercial CFD and FEA softwares.
<br><br>
Please see an image from a simple multiphase slag flow simulation I have created using multiphaseInterFoam on OpenFoam.

This portfolio showcases the engineering projects I have undertaken,
In my time studying for my Meng In mechanical Engineering at the University of Birmingham,
and as a Research and Development Engineer at a steel slag valorisation startup (Cocoon Carbon) 
working alongside engineers and scientists developing a novel slag upcycling process. 

About me:
I'm a passionate engineer, driven by a deep curiosity for how things work and a desire to solve real-world problems.
I thrive on hands-on projects and continuous learning, always looking for opportunities to apply theory to practice. 
Which the projects on this website showcase. 
I also enjoy sports, I play Ice hockey and football, but I can watch anything and have a great time.

My hobbies Include reading, I'm currently halfway through the second book in the three musketeers story by Dumas, which I highly recommend. 
And I have recently got into FPV drone design, I like the customisation available in the 
avionics and analog cameras are quite cool. Plus being able to fly them is extremely fun.

While you're here, take a look at the other posts to learn more about my previous projects!

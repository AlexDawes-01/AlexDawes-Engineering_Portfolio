**My Experience developing Matehmatical models**

I have developed several mathematical models in my time as a student and an engineer, two i would like to highlight are a Finite difference approximation 
that i used to evaluate temperatures within an induction furnace. And a cylindrical stress calculator to calcaulate stresses within an arrangment of stacked cylinders 
undergoing thermal expansion, where thermal stress arise from different expansion co-efficients.

The above equations are the same, as in they are determining the same profile. Only the one on the right is the discretised version that
i used to implement on a computer, using python. With this method, i could assign points within the area of interest nodes, and determine how
heat was transferred across these nodes. Using experimentally derived source terms and appropriate boundary conditions, I used the method
to simulate the behaviour of a graphite susceptor in an induction furnace encased in refractory materials. Which was then used to 
determine what power was to be applied for appropriate tempertaure control. Several graphite gemoetries were investigated.
